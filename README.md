# Podcast Intelligence

**Ever wished you could have a conversation with your favorite podcast? Now you can!** This project transforms podcast episodes into interactive, AI-driven experiences, allowing users to dive deeper into the content and ask questions directly about the episode.

Using the popular RAG (**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**) technique, this project brings podcasts to life.

## Project Context

This project leverages AI to interact with podcast episodes using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process. The system allows users to ask questions about a specific podcast episode and receive natural-sounding responses based on the episode content.

### Key Steps in the Process:

1. **Audio Retrieval**: 
   - A script is used to fetch podcast episodes from RSS feeds.
   
2. **Transcription**: 
   - The audio is converted into text using OpenAI's Whisper model, ensuring high-quality transcription.

3. **Text Chunking and Diarization**: 
   - The transcribed text is split into manageable chunks, and speaker diarization is performed to identify different speakers and their corresponding timestamps.

4. **Embedding Creation**: 
   - Only the transcribed text (without diarization metadata) is converted into embeddings using a pre-trained language model for efficient similarity searches.

5. **Database Storage**: 
   - Both the text embeddings and diarization results are stored in an optimized PostgreSQL database, designed for fast retrieval based on cosine similarity.

6. **Question-Answering**: 
   - When a user asks a question, it is converted into embeddings. Using cosine similarity, relevant chunks of the podcast are retrieved from the database. The retrieved text is inserted into a prompt for a Large Language Model (LLM), which generates a natural response based on the podcast content.
